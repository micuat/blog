[Liza Dieckwisch](https://www.instagram.com/lizadieckwisch/) is organizing collective (and virtual) pink and yellow cooking. When you subscribe, you will get a new recipe every week and we all cook on Sundays. A report of the past weeks can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/pink-and-yellow-1-en/) and [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/pink-and-yellow-2-en/). The fifth week was spread for bread. It was supposed to be sunny side up colored with beetroot juice, but I forgot some ingredients and had to run to a shop to get beetroot spread as a substitute.

The sixth week was souffle pancake with pomegranate cream. For this, I practiced a few times to make souffle pancake which is popular in Japan. The trick is to mix whipped egg white instead of baking powder. I had hard time making fluffy pancakes, so I cooked a Japanese "traditional" style, which is made with baking powder. Also, opening a pomegranate is a lot of fun (fortunately, I was careful enough not to spill too much juice).
