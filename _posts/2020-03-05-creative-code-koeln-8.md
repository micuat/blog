The 8th meetup of [Creative Code Köln](https://creativecodekoeln.github.io/) took place on March 5th at [akkuraum](https://www.akkuraum.com/) in Cologne. Please read the [first post]({{ site.baseurl }}/creative-code-koeln-1) if you want to know the philosophy of the meetup and why I started it.

This time Alex visited us and we talked about the current projects we are working on. I have started working at Hochschule Dusseldorf; since it is a project involving multiple technical components such as robotics and image processing, talking with other artists helps me reframing the structure and finding different solutions.

I will be out of town for the next 2 weeks, so [the next meetup](https://www.meetup.com/akkuraum/events/cxlllrybcfbjc/) will be held on March 26th at Akkuraum. I hope to see you there!
