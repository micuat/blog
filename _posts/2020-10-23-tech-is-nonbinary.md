Tech is Nonbinary is an audiovisual dance performance. Starting from a blank editor, graphics and sound are coded in real-time by live-coding environments, with expressions of body movements. The artist questions the classical way of rigid frameworks and productive scheme through an ephemeral and experimental nature of live coding. As images are generated by computer programs, the video may include flickering by accident.
