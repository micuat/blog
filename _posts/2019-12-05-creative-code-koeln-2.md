The second meetup of [Creative Code K√∂ln](https://creativecodekoeln.github.io/) took place on December 5, 2019 at [akkuraum](https://www.akkuraum.com/) in Cologne. Please read the [first post]({{ site.baseurl }}/creative-code-koeln-1) if you want to know the philosophy of the meetup and why I started it.

This time, [Alex Rechberg](http://www.alexanderrechberg.com/) visited us and gave an introduction to [Cables](https://cables.gl/). It is a patching programming language on browser, similar to vvvv and Max (but you can do more with JavaScript and GLSL), and you can easily create interactive web apps with it. Within ten minutes, he built a scene with animated objects, and he also showed us how to share the project and how to import other artists' patch in your project. He has been working with the developer and using Cables for production including the upcoming performance at [Temps d'Images Festival](https://tanzhaus-nrw.de/en/event/2020/01/showing) at tanzhaus nrw.

At the last meetup I showed [Hydra](https://hydra-editor.glitch.me/), and its creator, Olivia, just released [Pixeljam](https://pixeljam.glitch.me/), which is another version of Hydra for real-time online collaboration. If you enter, the window is split into three, which represent three video buffers, and anyone can change the code on each buffer with a chat-like interface. In the next meetups I would like to introduce its basic syntax so that we can start jamming during the creative code meetup (also with anonymous people online).
