The 5th meetup of [Creative Code Köln](https://creativecodekoeln.github.io/) took place on February 9th at [akkuraum](https://www.akkuraum.com/) in Cologne. Please read the [first post]({{ site.baseurl }}/creative-code-koeln-1) if you want to know the philosophy of the meetup and why I started it.

This time again, Tada came to the meetup. Since I have organized [Processing Community Day Tokyo]({{ site.baseurl }}/processing-community-day-tokyo-2020-en/) (PCD Tokyo) last weekend, we watched some of the talks from the streaming. Although I was not at the event and helped organization remotely, I am glad that we can watch talks online. Also, congratulations to Mayuko, who came to the CCK before, for giving a presentation at PCD Tokyo. It is great to have an exchange between communities in Tokyo and Cologne.
