p-code Land is an experimental virtual space for collective music live-coding. The syntax is based on [p-code](https://github.com/p-code-magazine/p-code) but numbers denote MIDI notes not frequencies, and some features are added.

For the syntax and further information, please visit [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/p-code-oreore).
