Call Stack by Naoto Hieda and Janine Harrington takes place within "digital performance" by the <a href="http://www.favoriten-festival.de/" target="_blank">FAVORITEN Festival</a> funded by the NRWkultursekretariat.

Call Stack is a collaboration between the media artist Naoto Hieda and the choreographer Janine Harrington. Despite different expertises, their common ground is geometric structures and algorithmic processes; Naoto programs performatively by generative algorithms and live-coding, and Janine choreographs through processes like coding, language and dance puzzle-games. They seek to find a poetic language in relation to the movement and program code, therefore building a bank of poems that contains texts, drawings, videos, algorithms and body movements on an online platform such as Instagram.
