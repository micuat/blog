The 6th meetup of [Creative Code Köln](https://creativecodekoeln.github.io/) took place on February 13th at [akkuraum](https://www.akkuraum.com/) in Cologne. Please read the [first post]({{ site.baseurl }}/creative-code-koeln-1) if you want to know the philosophy of the meetup and why I started it.

This time, I joined p5.js online call for a discussion about a rotating model of its leadership. Although I needed to leave halfway, I am looking forward to being part of the discussion process as someone involved in Processing communities in different parts of the world.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have set a goal of moving to a rotating model of leadership with p5.js. You are invited to join a conversation to discuss how that might work, and what we imagine for the future of p5 leadership. All are welcome. Thursday, Feb 13 from 9-10:30am PST @ <a href="https://t.co/1Tq95tJFoU">https://t.co/1Tq95tJFoU</a></p>&mdash; p5.js (@p5xjs) <a href="https://twitter.com/p5xjs/status/1226937215038545920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Then, Max visited us, who is a new collaborator of mine. We talked about project-related but also general inspirations about visuals such as [cineshader](https://cineshader.com/). We also talked about art centers in the area - one of my ideas is to organize an audiovisual performance night in the frame of Creative Code, and I am hoping to find more people interested in this domain as performers.
