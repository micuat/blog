Virtual Exhibition (working title, a solo performance by Naoto Hieda) is a hybrid live-code-dance performance that travels between modalities such as images, emotions as words, sounds and movements through a perspective of Asperger's, simultaneously exhibited on a custom online platform. I used to do a daily practice with which I associate my emotion evoked through mediation to sketching and improvisational dance. Based on this idea, I go through an emotion vocabulary on the stage (terms are: boredom, annoyance, interest, serenity, acceptance, apprehension, distraction, and pensiveness, taken from [Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_classification#Plutchik's_wheel_of_emotions)), recording my movements with a webcam in webm format. To relate the movement to a figure, I use Google image search to find an object and projected as a backdrop. The emotion terms and explanations of the performance are typed into a custom-built chat interface to be shown to the audience instead of a spoken language. Although I am performing in the same space, the words are sent to the Internet, shown on the projection, isolating the stage from the audience to create a personal sphere. Simultaneously, each byte of an input text is translated into sound in a live-coding manner based on p-code syntax developed by Yosuke Hayashi. Therefore, the chat interface is used not only to communicate with the audience but also to create sounds on the fly to help myself evoking emotions. Every recording of the movements is uploaded on a virtual space made with three.js; the platform resembles a white gallery space, and the exhibited artworks are the recordings. The concept of the virtual gallery is to blur the boundary between archival and exhibition. As every data in the dataset becomes visible as exhibited, the importance and authenticity of the data is revealed. At the same time, the ephemerality of digital data and physical movements lets people wonder if the value exists in the act or in the code (in other words, the algorithm) itself.

Work in progress, performed on Feb 5, 2020 at Phil Collins' seminar showing at Academy of Media Arts Cologne.  
Online exhibition can be accessed [here](https://naotohieda.com/ve/003) (Chrome only).

Walk 4 Me by Christopher Matthews and Naoto Hieda is an interactive digital dance work exploring tensions between the pedestrian, performance, distribution of labour and the icon. The work references ‪Janet Jackson‬'s concert stage walks and places the audience (visitor) in an interactive relationship with the performance through a programme designed by performance coder Naoto Hieda.

Walk 4 Me is Matthews' and Hieda's second project together following Lads (2017/18) which was presented in London at the V&A Museum and in New York at Future Oceans, JCC Manhattan with support from Arts Council England and Dance4.

Requires video projection and a motion sensor (webcam).
