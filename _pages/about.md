This is a blog page of [naotohieda.com](https://naotohieda.com).

As I am supporting the idea of [distributed network](https://taeyoonchoi.com/soft-care/distributed-web-of-care/), I started be aware of how contents on the Internet are hosted and linked to each other. This blog website is an opportunity for me to experiment with both in conventional and in nonconventional ways of archiving. There may be texts (in English, Japanese or other language), images, or interactive JavaScript codes.

I also post on [medium.com](https://medium.com/@naoto_hieda) and on [note.mu](https://note.mu/naoto_hieda) for English and Japanese articles, respectively. I have accounts on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/micuat), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/naoto_hieda), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/micuat/), Gmail and various other platforms. I do not think that it is a *bad* thing to be part of these platforms' ecosystems. We give and receive likes and comments as feedback, and new networks and communities grow through these processes. Nevertheless, it is important for us to be aware of what they might do with our data and also to have alternative places where we can govern by ourselves (and yes, this website is not totally independent, and I must credit Github Pages for hosting this website and Disqus for enabling comments).
